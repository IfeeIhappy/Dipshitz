# About me

Hi! I'm Tyler: a recovering American, living in England with my partner and our miniature dachshund. 

I write about the web and automation, and specifically look at ways to make those things more accessible and useful for everyone, including folks who aren't "tech-y". You'll usually see my name tied to doing fun things with Google Sheets, simple programming languages, and productivity tips that are (I hope) actually practical.

If you'd like to say hi, you can reach me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/aTylerRobertson)! ðŸ‘‹
