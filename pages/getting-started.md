# Getting started

To start blogging with Oregano, you'll first need a [Glitch](https://glitch.com) account. That will let you **remix** this app:

## [Click here to remix!](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/oregano-blog)

That will create a brand new copy of this app on your own account. 

## What comes in the box

When you remix Oregano, you'll have access to five main components:

* **oregano.js**: This is where the brains of the entire operation live, and where you'll input your blog's unique settings.
* **.env**: A secret file just for you, which comes built into each Glitch project. That's where you'll set a secret key that lets you publish from anywhere.
* **posts/**: A folder that holds all of your blog posts as `.md` Markdown files. 
* **pages/**: A folder for all of the Markdown files that aren't blog posts, like your site's index or about page.
* **views/ and css/**: These folders dictate the look and feel of your site, using CSS and [Pug](https://pugjs.org/)

## Make it your own

When you're logged in and editing your new copy of Oregano, the first thing you'll want to do is head to `oregano.js` and check out the very first line, which is your `site` settings. There, you can adjust each of the following:

* **title**: The primary title of your site -- Appears on every page, and in the browser tab
* **description**: A brief description of your site, used for search results and some social sharing
* **url**: Your site's primary URL (ex.: "https://YourSite.com")
* **image**: The default image for your site, primarily used on social media
* **favicon**: The icon that appears in the browser tab
* **header**: Links to display in your site's header, beneath the title. Uses this format: `{"Link 1":"URL 1","Link 2":"URL 2"}`
* **footer**: Links to display in your site's footer. Uses the same format as header.
* **posts**: The folder that your blog posts are kept in
* **pages**: The folder that pages - files that you can link to directly, but aren't listed on the index page - are kept.
* **rss**: Where people can go to get an RSS feed for your site
* **blog**: Where users request blog posts from, ex.: "blog" publishes your posts at https://YourSite.com/blog
* **write**: Where you send new posts to be published, ex.: using "write" means you can send new posts to https://YourSite.com/write

Then, you can start adding new Markdown files to your `pages/` and `posts/` folders, and Oregano will start publishing right away! 

You can also poke around in `css/` where a single CSS file changes how the site looks, and `views/`, where a Pug file informs the site's layout.

## Write anything from anywhere

When you create a new post in Oregano, it automatically assumes that the first line in the file is your post's title (yes, that means that you can title a post with an image, you maniac). There's no tagging, categorizing, or front-matter to worry about: everything you write will appear on the page. When you need to update a post, there's no re-publish button: just edit the markdown file! 

You can create markdown files and write new posts directly within Glitch's interface (which is so good that I wrote half of the code from my phone), but using Express also gives Oregano a really cool ability: you can use the `/write` endpoint to publish new content from anywhere. All you have to do is make a "POST" request to your site's `/write` endpoint, and include:

1. The **markdown** content that you want to publish
2. Your site's super secret **key**, which you set in `.env`

For example, if I want to make a post that just says "Hello, world!", I can pop this into any web browser:

`https://example-oregano-blog.glitch.me/write?key=SuperSecretKey1234&markdown=Hello, world!`

Oregano's code receives that request with Express, figures out what to call the file based on the first line (or inserts the current time if it's hard to tell), and adds it as a markdown file to your `posts/` folder.

You can use that same process to post from your favorite writing app, like [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) or an automation tool like [Zapier](https://zapier.com) (disclosure: I work at Zapier, but I'd still mention it here). 

## What if I find a bug, or have a question?

Well, I can't honestly promise that I'll fix any bugs, because this is genuinely an in-my-free-time project, but I'd love to chat about anything you find! If you run into any trouble or have questions, please feel free to [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/aTylerRobertson)! ðŸ‘‹
