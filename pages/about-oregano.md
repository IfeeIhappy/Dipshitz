# About Oregano

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Tyler](https://tyler.robertson.click), a writer who (up until recently) had a problem with blogging: it was too much. 

Let me clarify: blogging platforms, like WordPress or Squarespace, had too many features, all trying to pull me in various directions that I had no interest in. This was annoying specifically because writing is my day job, and I wanted to keep my _for-fun_ writing as simple as possible. All I really wanted was a space to drop words off, and maybe link back to them on Twitter. In my mind, the ideal blogging platform only has three features:

1. It lets me write in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
2. I get full control over my code and content
3. It lets me post from my phone

After a year of searching, nothing quite fit the bill, so I decided to make my own. I'm not a developer, but I'm pretty good at googling, and a few months later here we are: the smallest, simplest, feature-less blogging that I wanted this whole time. It's worked out pretty well for me so far, so I'm sharing it here for you to use, as well! 

Oregano is powered by [Glitch](https://glitch.com), a simple tool for creating web apps. It uses [Express](https://expressjs.com) to receive and handle requests (like when someone wants to read a post), and [Showdown](https://showdownjs.com) and [Pug](https://pugjs.com) to make sure your content gets displayed correctly. All of the code powering Oregano fits into fewer than 150 over-commented lines of Javascript, so there's plenty of room to play around and make it grow with you.
