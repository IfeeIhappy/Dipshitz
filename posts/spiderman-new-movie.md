Marvel has released the trailer for the long-awaited movie Spider-Man: No Way Home, which will appear as the third movie of the Spider-Man character in the MCU universe. The trailer clearly shows the multiverse connection and Doctor Strange, which is the theme of the 4th phase of the MCU. 

Marvel, which has taken the world of cinema from the first Avengers movie to Avengers: Endgame, has released the first official trailer of Spider-Man: No Way Home, one of the most curious productions of the 4th stage of the Cinematic Universe. As a matter of fact, the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was leaked to the internet just one day before the official release, and Marvel, which attaches great importance to privacy in its productions, has become the humor material of social media with this leak. Written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, Spider-Man: No Way Home is directed by Jon Watts. The cast includes Tom Holland, who plays the character of Spider-Man, as well as Marisa Tomei as Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon and Aunt May. In the meantime, let's not forget that Spider-Man: No Way Home will be in theaters on December 17th.
