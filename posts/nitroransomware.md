The new ransomware called “NitroRansomware” requests a Discord Nitro gift code to decrypt it after it encrypts the files of victims it infects. While ransomware often demands thousands of dollars, it is considered unusual for ransomware to accept only $9 worth of Discord Nitro gift codes. BleepingComputer researchers believe that this malware was distributed through a tool that claims to distribute "Free Discord Nitro Code". When the malware is first run, it first converts the files into encrypted files with the ".givemenitro" extension.

The victim is then shown a screen telling them that if you don't pay within 3 hours, they will delete your files.
