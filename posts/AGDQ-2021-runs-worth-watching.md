# AGDQ 2021 runs worth watching

[Awesome Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com) is running this week, raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation (**edit:** it's over now, and raised $2.7million!). It's one of my favorite events of the year, and I'm going to update this post through the next few days with a list of runs I watched and think you should too (I haven't watched all of them yet and I'm sure all of them are great, these are just what I've enjoyed most so far). 

If you've never seen a speedrun before, it's similar to watching someone livestream a video game on Twitch. Except in this case, the person playing the game is extremely practiced, and is beating the game as quickly/stylishly as possible. If there's a game you recognize from childhood on this list (looking at you, _Ecco the Dolphin_ fans), prepare to have your nostalgia utterly destroyed:
