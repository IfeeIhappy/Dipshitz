The American company Tesla, which produces electric vehicles, has taken up the production of robots. The company is preparing to produce a humanoid robot.

The goal is to save people from dangerous, boring and repetitive work. Developed with artificial intelligence, the robot is designed to do tasks such as tightening bolts and grocery shopping. 

Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, said that the robot will be used for physical work. He drew attention to the success they achieved in driverless vehicles. Musk said, "Tesla is probably the largest robot factory in the world. Because the vehicles we produce are like wheeled robots. The future physical work will be a choice. Those who want to do it will do it, but those who don't want to do it won't have to." 

Musk also responded to concerns that artificial intelligence could attack humans in the future. Elon Musk said, "It will be possible to escape from this robot. It will also be possible to neutralize it. We hope it will never be needed, but we do not know what will happen." 

The first prototype of the robot, called the "Tesla bot", is aimed to be ready next year. Some experts find this goal too ambitious. 

The 1 meter 70 centimeters tall robot will be able to move at a maximum speed of 8 kilometers per hour for safety reasons.
