Hello Offroaders! The new open world off-road driving simulator is here! It's time to get Off The Road!

Beat challenges to earn money and upgrade your car. Make it stronger, faster, look more awesome!
Earn xp to level up and get cool rewards.


[DRIVE ANYWHERE]
Using your car's winch you can climb the highest mountains, nothing can stop you. Thanks to the accurate rope physics the cable rope behaves realistically. You can drive boats to travel the sea or fly a helicopter to get anywhere easily.

[SIMULATION]
Realistic damage model for vehicles. Falls, crashes deform your car's chassis. Tyre pressure is simulated, tires deform based on load. Simulated water ripples, buoyancy etc.

[CHALLENGES]
Try to be fast to beat the Checkpoint Hunt challenges, use your off-roading skills to reach checkpoints in Pathfinder challenges. Find and transport the required materials for Transport challenges!

[TRANSPORTATION]
Use trailers to transport materials to their destinations, or use your winch to attach to objects in the world and drag them around freely.

[CONSTRUCTION]
Construct houses, bridges, roads, vehicles by transporting the required materials to the site!

[VEHICLES]
Drive off-road 4x4 cars, trucks, off-road behemoths, boats, helicopters!

# 2. Turboprop Flight Simulator

FLY MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND PASSENGER AIRLINERS:

"Turboprop Flight Simulator" is a new 3D airplane simulator game, featuring planes derived from the Airbus A400M Atlas tactical airlifter, the ATR 42 / ATR 72 regional airliners, and a concept VTOL aircraft XV-40.


HAVE FUN:

* Pilot three versions of the military aircraft: tactical cargo, coastguard, and spec-ops.
* Pilot the two regional airliners, plus an airborne early warning military variant.
* Pilot the Tilt-Wing VTOL aircraft (both in airplane mode, and in vertical, helicopter-like mode).
* Learn to fly with training missions (teaching the basics of flying, taxiing, takeoff and landing).
* Complete many varied missions.
* Explore the plane's interior in first-person (in most levels and freeflight).
* Interact with various items (doors, cargo ramp, strobes, main lights).
* Drive ground vehicles.
* Load, unload, and airdrop supplies and vehicles with the cargo planes.
* Takeoff and land on improvised runways (and airports, of course).
* Explore without restrictions in free-flight mode, or create flight routes on the map.
* Fly in varied time-of-day settings.


OTHER FEATURES:

* NEW & FREE airplane simulator game updated in 2021!
* NO MANDATORY ADS! Only optional, rewarded ones in-between flights.
* Great 3D graphics (with detailed cockpits for all the aeroplanes).
* Realistic physics for flight simulation.
* Complete pilot controls (including rudder, flaps, spoilers, thrust reversers, auto-brakes, and landing gear).
* Multiple control options (including mixed tilt sensor & stick / yoke).
* Multiple cameras (including cockpit cameras with captain and copilot positions).
* Close to realistic engines' sounds (turbines and propellers noises recorded from real airplanes).
* Partial and total aircraft destruction (clipping wing tips, full wings separation, tail separation, and main fuselage breakage).
* Several islands with many airports.
* Selection of measurement units for air speed, flying altitude, and distance (metric, aviation standard, and imperial).
