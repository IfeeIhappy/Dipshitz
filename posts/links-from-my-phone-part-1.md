# Links from my phone, part 1 /üì±üîó 1Ô∏è‚É£

It's important to know that, on desktop computers, I am fastidious about browser tabs: If a tab isn't actively in use, it gets closed. Immediately.

On my phone, not so much. Webpages, especially interesting ones, tend to get left open, maybe forever. I couldn't tell you why, maybe it's a layout thing, maybe it's because I only use my phone on the toilet, who could say? All I know is it's kind of a mess, and honestly one of my browser apps stopped working this week, and that's why I'm writing this. 

Weekly-ish, or whenever I've accumulated multiple tabs that I'm scared of losing, I'm going to do my best to get those links out of my browser and onto a page. You might think they're interesting, you might not, who knows! But maybe they'll serve as a fun weekend recap of the dumb links I've opened that week. Here we go!

The roguelike celebration does what it says on the tin: celebrates roguelikes! With 2020 being what it was, they took their annual conference online, and held it _in a roguelike_. Like, you could actually log in and traverse a virtual event space as a little **@** character. 

I didn't find out about the event until the first day and wasn't able to go, but I've had the page open for at least a month now, meaning to watch all the talks.

It's a Mac app that turns your new folders into random bird names! How cute!

I've been noodling around a little with Pico-8 again, and 3D projects like this one always amaze me. Pico-8 is designed with limitations in mind, and Powersaurus has absolutely pushed those limitations to the brink here. 

And yet, despite operating at the brink of the fantasy console's capabilities, it's remarkably meditative. (Designed for Mac/PC, but works OK on the phone!)
