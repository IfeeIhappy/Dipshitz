# How to make an escape room in Google Sheets

Alright, I have to start with a confession: I've never been to an escape room. It's on my post-pandemic to-do list, but as of now I've only attended one digital escape room experience, and it was enough to make me make this spreadsheet. I say that to say, _please don't confuse this spreadsheet for a professional escape room_. It's a proof of concept, nothing more. (That said, if you're an escape room designer who's interested in spreadsheets, [let's talk!](https://twitter.com/aTylerRobertson))

The online escape room I went to was hosted partly in Zoom, and partly in a custom-built website, with several clues requiring the players to open a "puzzle box" in Google Sheets, where they'd solve a series of math or cypher-related conundrums. It was, despite a few of the natural bumps that come with navigating Zoom calls, a pretty fun experience.

And, naturally, it got me thinking: **What if you did everything in Google Sheets?** 

If the entire experience was kept within Google Sheets, you could cut out the host and the custom website requirements, and build a variety of escape rooms relatively quickly. They'd be easier to distribute, too, thanks to the ubiquity of Google Docs. Is it a sustainable business? I'm not sure!
